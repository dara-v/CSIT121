<h2> Hi, my name is D'Ara! </h2>

<p> This is my "Three Things" website. I'm putting everything that I have learned in CSIT 121 by building a multi-website!</p>

<p> This site was hand-coded in a text editor called Sublime Text. All images are local. I repeated an image in the background for each page and used simple styles to make the page easy to read. </p>
