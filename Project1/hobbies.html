<h2> Hobbies </h2>

<p> This is my Gaming PC that I built in January 2021. Putting everything together and seeing it all turn on properly was very fun and satisfying. Ever since I built my Gaming PC, I've found a new hobby that I enjoyed doing. That's why I decided that I wanted to become a Computer Hardware Engineer after graduating from college. </p>
