<h2> Favorite Game </h2>

<p> My favorite game is called "osu!" and I've been playing ever since February 2021. </p>

<p> osu! is a free-to-play rhythm game. In this game, you have to simply follow the numbers and click the circles to the beat of the music, and hold the trails with your mouse. If you miss too many, the song will stop and you'll fail.</p>
